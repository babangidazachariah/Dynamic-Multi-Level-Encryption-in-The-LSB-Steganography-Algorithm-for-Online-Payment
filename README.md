# A Dynamic Multi Level Encryption in The LSB Steganography Algorithm for Online Payment

This project proposes and implements an online payment solution that relies on account number instead of Debit/Visa cards (or any other such cards), following that there are known security challenges related to card-based payment solutions. For example, card data may be store by marchant or intercepted through man-in-middle attack. Therefore, this solution combines encryption of data and steganography techniques to enhance security [<a href="https://github.com/babangidazachariah/Dynamic-Multi-Level-Encryption-in-The-LSB-Steganography-Algorithm-for-Online-Payment/blob/main/A_Novel_Structured_Least_Significant_Bit.pdf">1</a>]. Also, the solution brings user into the loop of payment where the user approves or decline payments (unknown payments) [<a href="https://github.com/babangidazachariah/Dynamic-Multi-Level-Encryption-in-The-LSB-Steganography-Algorithm-for-Online-Payment/blob/main/Ismail_BabangidaZachariah.pdf">2</a>]. All these can be done within significantly minimal and acceptable delays, just to give power of control in the hands of users through the mobile application.

To implement the proposed solution, various technologies such as <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging">Google Cloud Messaging</a> and <a href="https://github.com/contributte/nusoap">NuSOAP</a> were used.

The following are the papers that resulted form the project.
